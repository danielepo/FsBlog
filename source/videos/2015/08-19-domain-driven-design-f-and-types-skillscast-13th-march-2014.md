    Title = "Domain Driven Design, F# and Types | SkillsCast | 13th March 2014";
    Description = "Want to find out ways you can use types as part of a domain driven process? With real world examples in F#, come along to this no jargon, no maths, no prior F# experience necessary event. Statically typed functional programming languages like F# encourage a very different way of thinking about types. The type system is your friend, not an annoyance, and can be used in many ways that might not be familiar to OO programmers.Types can be used to represent the domain in a fine-grained, self documenting way. And in many cases, types can even be used to encode business rules so that you literally cannot create incorrect code. You can then use the static type checking almost as an instant unit test - making sure that your code is correct at compile time.";
