Part of the Jet promise is training. We have a couple internal F# workshops that get regular rotation, as well as a few in the works to help our new engineers quickly get up to speed on our stack. We also will be offering free community classes for anyone who wants to learn F#. More on that in the future, I promise!

My favorite presentation, however, is the quick 30-minute overview I get to give every week to the non-technical new hires on why F# is awesome. [Check it out](/pdf/Non-Tech.pdf) and feel free to re-use any portion you would like! 

Happy #fsharp-ing. :)
