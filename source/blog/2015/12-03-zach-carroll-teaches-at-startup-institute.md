Thanks to our Zach Carroll, a new cohort of [Startup Institute](https://www.startupinstitute.com/) folks is learning Javascript! He spent the last couple days teaching an intro level class on Javascript, focusing on Objects, Arrays, and Functions. 

Zach actually started out as a student in their Product and Design track a few years ago -- it's where he got his start as a developer! Since then he's tried to stay involved with the organization; first, by serving as an alumni committee co-chair, and later, by teaching both the introductory class and the Javascript module on Functions, Arrays, and Objects. He loves giving back to the community that helped him in his career, as well as helping others through that 'A-ha! moment'. He also notes that teaching is a great way to test his own ability to verbalize software development and javascript concepts! 

Startup Institute describes their teachers as "leading practitioners in the industry" -- we think that fits Zach to a "T".
