It's not autumn in NYC without an F# conference! So we invented [F# Gotham](http://www.fsharpgotham.com/), an all-day event taking place at our own JetHangar in Hoboken. We're gathering October 17th to hear from such experts as [Phil Trelford](http://trelford.com/blog/), [Andrea Magnorsky](http://www.roundcrisis.com/), [Charles Petzold](http://www.charlespetzold.com), [Jon Harrop](http://www.ffconsultancy.com/), [Jack Pappas](https://twitter.com/jkpappas), and [Riccardo Terrell](https://twitter.com/trikace). 
<!--more-->  

We're starting the day with two workshops: 

- one for folks who have never seen F# before & are looking to get quickly up and running;
- the other is for folks looking to sharpen their F# skillset.

So whether you're new to F# or an old-hat willing to share the F# love, we're looking forward to meeting you! [Register quickly](http://www.fsharpgotham.com/register) before the early bird tickets run out!
