Last week, our Rachel Reese spoke at the [Microservices NYC](http://www.meetup.com/Microservices-NYC/) group, in a space at [ThoughtWorks NYC](http://info.thoughtworks.com/new-york/) space about our microservice architecture -- what building an event-driven microservice architecture means to us, as well as the lessons we have learned along the way. There was a fabulous discussion afterwards covering many features of our set up. If you haven't joined the microservices group yet, do so now! Better yet, offer to speak! ;) They're also on [twitter](https://twitter.com/microservicesny).

In case you missed the talk, it will be given again in Phoenix on August 26th at the [Northwest Valley .NET user group](http://www.nwvdnug.org/), in Nashville on August 29th at the [Music City Code](http://www.musiccitycode.com/) conference, and it will be recorded in November in Sweden at the [Oredev](http://oredev.org/) conference. There may also be a few other chances to catch it after this!
