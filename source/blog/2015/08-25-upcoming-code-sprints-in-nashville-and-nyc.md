At Jet, we believe in community and giving back. We first heard about the F# Community Code Sprint idea a couple years ago, when they popped up in [London](http://fsharpcommunitycodesprint.github.io/). They expanded to NYC and to Nashville shortly afterwards, and we're ready to host a round of code sprints again in [Nashville on August. 30](http://www.meetup.com/nashfsharp/events/223998272/) and in [NYC on Sept. 12](http://www.meetup.com/nyc-fsharp/events/224771690/).

The idea of a "community code sprint" is to bring together active members of the community to a single place for a fun event where we can hack together on interesting projects, fix some of those long-standing bugs and feature requests, write amazing samples for talks, improve (or create!) documentation, and more.
