# Jet Technology Blog 

The Jet Technology blog is powered by [FsBlog](https://github.comfsprojects/FsBlog), a blog-aware static site generator, mostly built in `F#`, and hosted with [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/). 

FsBlog uses some of the following community projects:

* [FAKE](http://fsharp.github.io/FAKE/) for the automation and scripting of the different tasks.
* [F# Formatting](http://tpetricek.github.io/FSharp.Formatting/) which deals with the Markdown and F# processing/colorization.
* [RazorEngine](https://github.com/Antaris/RazorEngine) which is used for the templating and embedded C# code.
* Some of the code that calls *RazorEngine* from F# is based on [Tilde](https://github.com/aktowns/tilde).
* [Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com/).
