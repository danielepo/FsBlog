      <description>&lt;p&gt;It's not autumn in NYC without an F# conference! So we invented &lt;a href="http://www.fsharpgotham.com/"&gt;F# Gotham&lt;/a&gt;, an all-day event taking place at our own JetHangar in Hoboken. We're gathering October 17th to hear from such experts as &lt;a href="http://trelford.com/blog/"&gt;Phil Trelford&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.roundcrisis.com/"&gt;Andrea Magnorsky&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.charlespetzold.com"&gt;Charles Petzold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.ffconsultancy.com/"&gt;Jon Harrop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jkpappas"&gt;Jack Pappas&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/trikace"&gt;Riccardo Terrell&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At Jet, we believe in community and giving back. We first heard about the F# Community Code Sprint idea a couple years ago, when they popped up in &lt;a href="http://fsharpcommunitycodesprint.github.io/"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;. They expanded to NYC and to Nashville shortly afterwards, and we're ready to host a round of code sprints again in &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/nashfsharp/events/223998272/"&gt;Nashville on August. 30&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/nyc-fsharp/events/224771690/"&gt;NYC on Sept. 12&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you have millions of products for sale and you have an algorithmic and dynamic pricing system for price changes on those products, what can possibly go wrong when advertising them?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week, our Rachel Reese spoke at the &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/Microservices-NYC/"&gt;Microservices NYC&lt;/a&gt; group, in a space at &lt;a href="http://info.thoughtworks.com/new-york/"&gt;ThoughtWorks NYC&lt;/a&gt; space about our microservice architecture -- what building an event-driven microservice architecture means to us, as well as the lessons we have learned along the way. There was a fabulous discussion afterwards covering many features of our set up. If you haven't joined the microservices group yet, do so now! Better yet, offer to speak! ;) They're also on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/microservicesny"&gt;twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Part of the Jet promise is training. We have a couple internal F# workshops that get regular rotation, as well as a few in the works to help our new engineers quickly get up to speed on our stack. We also will be offering free community classes for anyone who wants to learn F#. More on that in the future, I promise!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Jet's Tech Talk Weekly Series</title>
      <guid>http://techgroup.jet.com//blog/2015/07-14-tech-talk-weekly</guid>
      <link>http://techgroup.jet.com//blog/2015/07-14-tech-talk-weekly/index.html</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 14 Jul 2015 08:55:50 GMT</pubDate>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One lovely afternoon in mid-March, back in the old days of Jet (i.e., when we were still located in our Montclair, NJ offices) our awesome &lt;a href="http://extroverteddeveloper.com/"&gt;Jim Wallace&lt;/a&gt; took the initiative to start organizing weekly tech talks. Originally, we had envisioned gathering to simply watch a conference video that we all wish we'd seen live. We took a quick vote on Slack, and it was decided that our inaugural video would be Bart de Smet's &lt;a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/cloud-rx"&gt;Cloud-scale Event Processing using Rx.&lt;/a&gt;. We even threw in some company-sponsored pizza to make it more fun! ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we continued selecting videos, Jim whipped up a submission and voting site on Azure to figure out each week's videos. We aimed for a mix of topics, focusing on F# (of course!), DDD, Event-processing, and microservices.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>On how Jet chose F#</title>
      <guid>http://techgroup.jet.com//blog/2015/03-22-on-how-jet-chose</guid>
      <link>http://techgroup.jet.com//blog/2015/03-22-on-how-jet-chose/index.html</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 22 Mar 2015 16:38:14 GMT</pubDate>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;In the beginning&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first Jet prototype was written by our CTO, Mike Hanrahan, in his basement, in WCF. After the first developers were brought on, the first proper version of our site was spun up with CoffeeScript. However, Mike knew from the outset that he wanted to use F#, at least for the pricing engine, because of the benefits you often hear about F#: less code leading to fewer bugs, as well as code that is more robust and safer because of the type system, to name a few. As a company, we weren't sure that we should have F# anywhere else, though. After all, we're building an e-commerce web site. Isn't the web fully in the domain of C#? Plus, many of the developers on the team had an object-oriented or imperative background -- what if we wasted too much time figuring out this new language before we could even be productive?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, we started building two solutions: a C# solution and an F# solution, to see where they would take us. In the end, we chose to stick with the F# path. The main reason: we were able to deliver the same functionality with far less code. This clearly eases maintainability and reduces bugs. If you've been part of the F# community for any length of time, you know that this is a very well known feature of the language and a commonly cited reason to switch to F#. However, we had a few other unique-to-Jet reasons that we wanted to share.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2&gt;What is the F# Software Foundation?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The F# Software Foundation is a community-run non-profit Corporation that aims to promote and benefit the F# Programming Language. It began in 2012, and was organized formally into a non-profit in late 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more information on the Foundation, including additional &lt;a href="http://foundation.fsharp.org/history"&gt;history&lt;/a&gt;, or to read the &lt;a href="http://foundation.fsharp.org/"&gt;mission statement&lt;/a&gt; and latest &lt;a href="http://foundation.fsharp.org/board_meeting_minutes"&gt;board meeting minutes&lt;/a&gt; of the F# Software Foundation, see the &lt;a href="http://fsharp.org"&gt;fsharp.org&lt;/a&gt; site.&lt;/p&gt;
