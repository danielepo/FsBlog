## What is a Code Camp?

If you haven't attended, or heard of, code camps previously, you might be wondering what the fuss is all about. According to the [Code Camp wikipedia page]: 

> Code Camp is a form of an unconference. Originally begun as a Microsoft-slanted take on barcamp, but not strictly limited to the Microsoft Windows or .NET platforms. 
> 
> Code Camps are free to attend. Code Camps do not take place during the typical work week. Code Camps do not disclose attendee contact information to sponsors.
> 
> Like most unconferences, Code Camps are about your local or regional development community. Presenters are typically members of the community. Presentation topics are suggested by attendees, and often presented by those who originally suggest them.

Make sure you [register](http://www.codecampnyc.org/) soon! Tickets will go quickly.
