    Title = "REAL-TIME DEMOCRATIZING OF EVENT-DRIVEN BIG DATA on Vimeo";
    Description = "At Jet.com, we have a lot of data. A LOT of data. We needed a way to safely, quickly, and relevantly process and explore all our data. Using F# and an event-based microservices architecture, we're able to do all this and more. In this talk, we'll cover how we handle processing events from 300 microservices in to our data warehouse in real time, so that we can optimally react to our customers' wants and needs.";
